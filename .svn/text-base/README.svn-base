Python Control System Library
RMM, 23 May 09

This directory contains the source code for the Python Control Systems
Library (python-control).  This package provides a library of standard
control system algorithms in the python programming environment.

Installation instructions
-------------------------
Standard python package installation:

  python setup.py install

To see if things are working, you can run the script
examples/secord-matlab.py (using ipython -pylab).  It should generate a step
response, Bode plot and Nyquist plot for a simple second order linear
system.

You can also run a set of unit tests to make sure that everything is working
correctly.  After installation, run

  python tests/test_all.py

from the source distribution directory (note: doesn't yet work in python
3.x).  Alternatively, if you have nosetests installed, you can simply run

  nosetests

which gives a somewhat cleaner output (and works in python 3.x)

Slycot
------

Routines from the Slycot wrapper are used for providing the
functionality of several routines for state-space, transfer functions
and robust control. Many parts of python-control will still work
without slycot, but some functionality is limited or absent, and
installation of Slycot is definitely recommended.  The Slycot wrapper
can be found at:

https://github.com/repagh/Slycot

(was forked from https://github.com/avventi/Slycot, but
development/merging appear to have stopped there for now)
