# Utility function to unwrap an angle measurement

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array_like
        Input array
    period : number
        Input period (usually either 2``*``pi or 360)

    Returns
    -------
    Y : array_like
        Output array, with jumps of period/2 eliminated
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> X = [5.74, 5.97, 6.19, 0.13, 0.35, 0.57]
    >>> unwrap(X, period=2 * np.pi)
