# RMM, 17 June 2010: modified to be a standalone piece of code
#   * Added BSD copyright info to file (per Ryan)
#   * Added code to convert (num, den) to poly1d's if they aren't already.
#     This allows Ryan's code to run on a standard signal.ltisys object
#     or a control.TransferFunction object.
#   * Added some comments to make sure I understand the code
#
# RMM, 2 April 2011: modified to work with new Lti structure (see ChangeLog)
#   * Not tested: should still work on signal.ltisys objects
